# Churn Modeling

This project focuses on customer churn prediction using machine learning models. The goal is to identify patterns in customer data that indicate a higher likelihood of churn.

## Project Contents

- 'churnModeling.ipynb': Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- 'Churn_Modeling.csv': CSV file containing 10,000 rows of user data related to Churn rate

## How to Run the Notebook

You can run the notebook using any of the following environments:

### Google Colab
